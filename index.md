# Core Type Classes

This is a book about programming in Scala using a technique known as [type classes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class). It has three main goals:

1. to describe type classes and their implementation in Scala;
2. to describe the main abstractions, such as monoids, functors, and monads, taken from [abstract algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) that are useful for structuring programs written using type classes; and
3. to show how to apply these abstractions in real code, particularly by using such libraries such as [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and [Algebird](https://github.com/twitter/algebird).

By the time you finish this book you should be comfortable using type classes in Scala, but we aren't aiming for exhaustive coverage of Scalaz, for instance. Rather you should have the tools to explore this world on your own.

The book is structured as follows.

The introductory section describes type classes and their implementation in Scala using implicits. We then briefly discuss why abstract algebra is relevant to practical programs. Finally we survey the Scala libraries that we'll be spending more time with in later sections.

We then turn to one of the simplest type classes, the monoid.

etc.
