#+TITLE: Core Type Classes
* Introduction
** Overview
   - Scalaz
   - How to use its abstractions
   - How to find your way around
   - How to write your own abstractions
   - Focusing on three core abstractions: monoids, monads, and applicative functors

   - Implement functionality for any class
   - Implement multiple implementations of functionality
