#+TITLE: Core Type Classes
* Introduction
** Overview
   - Scalaz
   - How to use its abstractions
   - How to find your way around
   - How to write your own abstractions
   - Focusing on three core abstractions: monoids, monads, and applicative functors
** What are type classes?
   - Implement functionality for any class
   - Implement multiple implementations of functionality
   - Construction in Scala
     - Type class trait
     - Concrete instances
     - Implicit parameters
     - Enriched syntax
     - Implementation in Scalaz
       - Interface trick
       - Package organisation
         - Type class packages
         - Instance packages
         - Syntax packages
