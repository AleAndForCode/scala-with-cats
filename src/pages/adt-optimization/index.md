In the previous chapter we introduced interpreters as a key strategy.
In this chapter we'll turn to their optimization.
This is a huge subject, which we cannot hope to cover in just one book chapter.
Instead we'll focus on two techniques that I believe use key ideas found in more complex techniques: algebraic manipulation and compilation to a virtual machine.

We'll start looking at algebraic manipulation ...
