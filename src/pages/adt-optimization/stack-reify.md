## From Continuations to Stacks

In the previous section we explored regular expression derivatives. We saw that they are continuations, but reified as data structures rather than the functions we used when we first worked with continuation-passing style. In this section we'll reify continuations-as-functions as data. In doing so we'll find continuations implicitly encode a stack structure. Explicitly reifying this structure is a step towards implementing a stack machine.

We'll start with the CPSed regular expression interpreter (not using derivatives), shown below.

```scala mdoc:silent
enum Regexp {
  def ++(that: Regexp): Regexp =
    Append(this, that)

  def orElse(that: Regexp): Regexp =
    OrElse(this, that)

  def repeat: Regexp =
    Repeat(this)

  def `*` : Regexp = this.repeat

  def matches(input: String): Boolean = {
    // Define a type alias so we can easily write continuations
    type Continuation = Option[Int] => Option[Int]

    def loop(regexp: Regexp, idx: Int, cont: Continuation): Option[Int] =
      regexp match {
        case Append(left, right) =>
          val k: Continuation = _ match {
            case None    => cont(None)
            case Some(i) => loop(right, i, cont)
          }
          loop(left, idx, k)

        case OrElse(first, second) =>
          val k: Continuation = _ match {
            case None => loop(second, idx, cont)
            case some => cont(some)
          }
          loop(first, idx, k)

        case Repeat(source) =>
          val k: Continuation =
            _ match {
              case None    => cont(Some(idx))
              case Some(i) => loop(regexp, i, cont)
            }
          loop(source, idx, k)

        case Apply(string) =>
          cont(Option.when(input.startsWith(string, idx))(idx + string.size))

        case Empty =>
          cont(None)
      }

    // Check we matched the entire input
    loop(this, 0, identity).map(idx => idx == input.size).getOrElse(false)
  }

  case Append(left: Regexp, right: Regexp)
  case OrElse(first: Regexp, second: Regexp)
  case Repeat(source: Regexp)
  case Apply(string: String)
  case Empty
}
object Regexp {
  val empty: Regexp = Empty

  def apply(string: String): Regexp =
    Apply(string)
}
```

To reify the continuations we can apply the same recipe as before: we create a case for each place in which we construct a continuation.
In our interpreter loop this is for `Append`, `OrElse`, and `Repeat`. We also construct a continuation using the identity function when we first call `loop`, which represents the continuation to call when the loop has finished. This gives us four cases.

```scala
enum Continuation {
  case AppendK
  case OrElseK
  case RepeatK
  case DoneK
}
```

What data does each case next to hold?
Let's let look at the structure of the cases within the CPS interpreter.
The case for `Append` is typical.

```scala
case Append(left, right) =>
  val k: Cont = _ match {
    case None    => cont(None)
    case Some(i) => loop(right, i, cont)
  }
  loop(left, idx, k)
```

The continuation `k` refers to the `Regexp` `right`, the method `loop`, and the continuation `cont`.
Our reification should reflect this by holding the same data.
If we consider all the cases we end up with the following definition.
Notice that I implemented an `apply` method so we can still call these continuations like a function.

```scala
type Loop = (Regexp, Int, Continuation) => Option[Int]
enum Continuation {
  case AppendK(right: Regexp, loop: Loop, next: Continuation)
  case OrElseK(second: Regexp, index: Int, loop: Loop, next: Continuation)
  case RepeatK(regexp: Regexp, index: Int, loop: Loop, next: Continuation)
  case DoneK

  def apply(idx: Option[Int]): Option[Int] =
    this match {
      case AppendK(right, loop, next) =>
        idx match {
          case None    => next(None)
          case Some(i) => loop(right, i, next)
        }

      case OrElseK(second, index, loop, next) =>
        idx match {
          case None => loop(second, index, next)
          case some => next(some)
        }

      case RepeatK(regexp, index, loop, next) =>
        idx match {
          case None    => next(Some(index))
          case Some(i) => loop(regexp, i, next)
        }

      case DoneK =>
        idx
    }
}
```

Now we can rewrite the interpreter loop using the `Continuation` type.

```scala
def matches(input: String): Boolean = {
  def loop(
      regexp: Regexp,
      idx: Int,
      cont: Continuation
  ): Option[Int] =
    regexp match {
      case Append(left, right) =>
        val k: Continuation = AppendK(right, loop, cont)
        loop(left, idx, k)

      case OrElse(first, second) =>
        val k: Continuation = OrElseK(second, idx, loop, cont)
        loop(first, idx, k)

      case Repeat(source) =>
        val k: Continuation = RepeatK(regexp, idx, loop, cont)
        loop(source, idx, k)

      case Apply(string) =>
        cont(Option.when(input.startsWith(string, idx))(idx + string.size))

      case Empty =>
        cont(None)
    }

  // Check we matched the entire input
  loop(this, 0, DoneK)
    .map(idx => idx == input.size)
    .getOrElse(false)
}
```

The point of this construction is that we've reified the stack: it's now explicitly represented as the `next` field in each `Continuation`. The stack is a last-in first-out (LIFO) data structure: the last element we add to the stack is the first element we use. (This is exactly the same as efficient use of a `List`.) We construct continuations by adding elements to the front of the existing continuation, which is exactly how we construct lists or stacks. We use continuations from front-to-back; in other words in last-in first-out (LIFO) order. This is the correct access pattern to use a list efficiently, and also the access pattern that defines a stack. Reifying the continuations as data has reified the stack. In the next section we'll use this fact to build a compiler that targets a stack machine.
