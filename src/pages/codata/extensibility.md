## Data and Codata Extensibility

We have seen that codata can represent types with an infinite number of elements, such as the infinite stream we just implemented. This is one expressive difference from data, which must always be finite. We'll now look at another, which is the type of extensibility we get from data and from codata. Together these gives use guidelines to choose between the two.
