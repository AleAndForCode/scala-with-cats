## Codata in Scala

We have already seen an example of codata, which I have repeated below.

```scala mdoc:silent
trait Set[A] {
  
  def contains(elt: A): Boolean
  
  def insert(elt: A): Set[A]
  
  def union(that: Set[A]): Set[A]
}
```

The abstract definition of this, which is a product of functions, defines a `Set` with elements of type `A` as:

- a function `contains` taking a `Set[A]` and an element `A` and returning a `Boolean`,
- a function `insert` taking a `Set[A]` and an element `A` and returning a `Set[A]`, and
- a function `union` taking a `Set[A]` and a set `Set[A]` and returning a `Set[A]`.

Notice that the first parameter of each function is the type we are defining, `Set[A]`.

The translation to Scala is:

- the overall type becomes a `trait`; and
- each function becomes a method on that `trait`. The first parameter is the hidden `this` parameter, and other parameters become normal parameters to the method.

This gives us the Scala representation we started with.

This is only half the story for codata. We also need to actually implement the interface we've just defined. There are three approaches we can use:

1. a `final` subclass, in the case where we want to name the implementation;
2. an anonymous subclass; or
3. more rarely, an `object`.

Neither `final` nor anonymous subclasses can be further extended, meaning we cannot create deep inheritance hierarchies. This in turn avoids the difficulties that come from reasoning about deep hierarchies. Using a `class` rather than a `case class` means we don't expose implementation details like constructor arguments.

Some examples are in order. Here's a simple example of `Set`, which uses a `List` to hold the elements in the set.

```scala mdoc:silent
final class ListSet[A](elements: List[A]) extends Set[A] {

  def contains(elt: A): Boolean =
    elements.contains(elt)

  def insert(elt: A): Set[A] =
    ListSet(elt :: elements)

  def union(that: Set[A]): Set[A] =
    elements.foldLeft(that) { (set, elt) => set.insert(elt) }
}
object ListSet {
  def empty[A]: Set[A] = ListSet(List.empty)
}
```

This uses the first implementation approach, a `final` subclass. Where would we use an anonymous subclass? They are most useful when implementing methods that return our codata type. Let's take `union` as an example. It returns our codata type, `Set`, and we could implement it as shown below.

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
trait Set[A] {
  
  def contains(elt: A): Boolean
  
  def insert(elt: A): Set[A]
  
  def union(that: Set[A]): Set[A] = {
    val self = this
    new Set[A] {
      def contains(elt: A): Boolean =
        self.contains(elt) || that.contains(elt)
        
      def insert(elt: A): Set[A] =
        // Arbitrary choice to insert into self
        self.insert(elt).union(that)
    }
  }
}
```

This uses an anonymous subclass to implement `union` on the `Set` trait, and hence defines the method for all subclasses. I haven't made the method `final` so that subclasses can override it with a more efficient implementation. This does open up the danger of implementation inheritance. This is an example of where theory and craft diverge. In theory we never want implementation inheritance, but in practice it can be useful as an optimization.

It can also be useful to implement utility methods defined purely in terms of the destructors. Let's say we wanted to implement a method `containsAll` that checks if a `Set` `contains` all the elements in an `Iterable` collection.

```scala
def containsAll(elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean
```

We can implement this purely in terms of `contains` on `Set` and `forall` on `Iterable`.

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
trait Set[A] {
  
  def contains(elt: A): Boolean
  
  def insert(elt: A): Set[A]
  
  def union(that: Set[A]): Set[A]
  
  def containsAll(elements: Iterable[A]): Boolean =
    elements.forall(elt => this.contains(elt))
}
```

Once again we could make this a `final` method. In this case it's probably more justified as it's difficult to imagine a more efficient implementation.

Data and codata are both realized in Scala as variations of the same language features of classes and objects. This means we can define types that have properties of both data and codata. We have actually already done this. When we define data we must define names for the fields within the data, thus defining destructors. This is the same in most languages, which don't make a hard distinction between data and codata. 

Part of the appeal, I think, of classes and objects is that they can express so many conceptually different abstractions with the same language constructs. This gives them a surface appearance of simplicity; it seems we need to learn only one abstraction to solve a huge of number of coding problems. However this apparent simplicity hides real complexity, as this variety of uses forces us to reverse engineer the conceptual intention from the code.
