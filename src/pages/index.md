# Essential Scalaz

The title of this book is "Essential Scalaz" and this book does cover the what and how of using Scalaz. However this book is not really about Scalaz per se, but Scalaz as a vehicle for exploring patterns for functional program design.

Let me quote [Don Stewart](https://donsbot.wordpress.com/), Haskell hacker extraordinaire at Standard Chartered Bank, [on the design of large systems in functional programming](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27852709/enterprise-patterns-with-functional-programming/27860072#27860072) 

> In my experience, almost all designs fall into the 'compiler' or
> 'interpreter' pattern, using a model of the data and functions on
> that data. That is, problem domains are represented as algebraic
> structures (objects as ADTs with functions over them), and software
> architectures are about mapping from one algebra to another. This is
> the "category theory" design pattern(!)

In this book, and the supplement, we are going to explore the many variations on this pattern.
