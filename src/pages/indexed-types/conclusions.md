## Conclusions


The earliest reference I've found to phantom types is [@10.1145/331960.331977].

The majority of research on generalized algebraic data types focuses on type checking and inference algorithms, which is not so relevant to the working programmer.
*Pointwise Generalized Algebraic Data Types* [@10.1145/1708016.1708024] is not different in this respect, but it does have a particularly clear breakdown of how GADTs are used in the most common case.


Indexed codata is described in [@10.1145/3022670.2951929].
