### Changelog {-}

Starting from the March 2016 release, here are the major changes to the book:

- Moved the theoretical chapters from Scalaz to Cats (currently version `0.7.2`).
- Added sections on the `Reader`, `Writer`, `State`, and `Eval` monads.
- Added a chapter on monad transformers.
- Added sections on `Cartesian` to the applicatives chapter.
- Added sections on `Foldable` and `Traverse`.
- Added type chart diagrams for `Functor` and `Monad`.

### Omissions {-}

Here are the major things missing from the book:

 1. We are missing some of the case studies
    that make up the last third of the book.
    These are in various states of completion
    so we have chosen to hold them back
    until we have a better idea of what they will look like.

 2. Some case studies are still written using Scalaz.

 3. Upgrade to Cats 1.0!
