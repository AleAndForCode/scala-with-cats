## Monoids in Scalaz

Now we've seen what a monoid is, let's look at their implementation in Scalaz. Once again we'll look at the three main aspects of the implementation: the *type class*, the *instances*, and the *interface*.

### The Monoid Type Class

The monoid type class is [`scalaz.Monoid`][scalaz.Monoid]. If we look at the implementation we see that `Monoid` extends `Semigroup`. A semigroup is a monoid without the identity element, leaving only `append`.

There are a few utility methods defined on `Monoid`, mostly to do with checking if an element is `zero` (assuming we have an implemenation for equality on the monoid, denoted by the `Equal` type class). These are not commonly used in practice.

### Obtaining Instances

`Monoid` follows the standard Scalaz pattern for the user interface: the companion object has an `apply` method that returns the type class instance. So if we wanted the monoid instance for `String`, and we have the correct implicits in scope, we can write the following:

~~~ scala
Monoid[String].append("Hi ", "there")
~~~

which is equivalent to

~~~ scala
Monoid.apply[String].append("Hi ", "there")
~~~

### Default Instances

The type class instances for `Monoid` are organised under `scalaz.std` in the standard way described in [Chapter 1](#importing-default-instances). For example, if we want to pull in instances for `String` we `import scalaz.std.string._`:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.Monoid
import scalaz.std.string._

val instance = Monoid[String]
instance.append("Monoids FTW!", instance.zero)
~~~

Refer back to [Chapter 1](#importing-default-instances) for a more comprehensive list of imports.

### Instances for Custom Types

There is a useful helper method on the `Monoid` companion object to help us declare instances for our own types:

~~~ scala
val bitwiseXorInstance: Monoid[Int] =
  Monoid.instance[Int](_ ^ _, 0)
~~~

### Monoid Syntax

We access the monoid syntax by importing `scalaz.syntax.monoid._`. This provides:

- the `|+|` operator for appending two values for which there is a monoid instance; and
- the `mzero` method to access the identity element for a monoid.

When we use `mzero` we usually have to specify a type to avoid ambiguity:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.syntax.monoid._
import scalaz.std.string._
import scalaz.std.anyVal._

val stringResult = "Hi " |+| "there" |+| mzero[String]
// stringResult: String = Hi there

val intResult = 1 |+| 2 |+| mzero[Int]
// intResult: Int = 3
~~~

### Exercise: Adding All The Things

The cutting edge *SuperAdder v3.5a-32* is the world's first choice for adding together numbers. The main function in the program has signature `def add(items: List[Int]): Int`. In a tragic accident this code is deleted! Rewrite the method and save the day!

<div class="solution">
We can write the addition as a simple `foldLeft` using `0` and the `+` operator:

~~~ scala
def add(items: List[Int]): Int =
  items.foldLeft(0){ _ + _ }
~~~

We can alternatively write the fold using `Monoids`, although there's not a compelling use case for this yet:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.Monoid
import scalaz.syntax.monoid._

def add(items: List[Int]): Int =
  items.foldLeft(mzero[Int]){ _ |+| _ }
~~~
</div>

Well done! SuperAdder's market share continues to grow, and now there is demand for additional functionality. People now want to add `List[Option[Int]]`. Change `add` so this is possible. The SuperAdder code base is of the highest quality, so make sure there is no code duplication:

<div class="solution">
Now there is a use case for `Monoids`. We need a single method that adds `Ints` and instances of `Option[Int]`. We can write this as a generic method that accepts an implicit `Monoid` as a parameter:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.Monoid
import scalaz.syntax.monoid._

def add[A](items: List[A])(implicit monoid: Monoid[A]): A =
  items.foldLeft(mzero[A]){ _ |+| _ }
~~~

We can optionally use Scala's *context bound* syntax to write the same code in a friendlier way:

~~~ scala
def add[A: Monoid](items: List[A]): A =
  items.foldLeft(mzero[A]){ _ |+| _ }
~~~
</div>

SuperAdder is entering the POS (point-of-sale, not the other POS) market. Now we want to add up `Orders`:

~~~ scala
case class Order(totalCost: Double, quantity: Double)
~~~

We need to release this code really soon so we can't make any modifications to `add`. Make it so!

<div class="solution">
Easy---we simply define a monoid instance for `Order`!
Notice the type signature of `append`---the second argument must be call-by-name:

~~~ scala
object Order {
  implicit val monoid: Monoid[Order] = new Monoid[Order] {
    def append(o1: Order, o2: => Order) =
      Order(o1.totalCost + o2.totalCost, o1.quantity + o2.quantity)

    def zero = Order(0, 0)
  }
}
~~~
</div>

### Exercise: Folding Without the Hard Work {#folding-without-the-hard-work}

Given a `Monoid[A]` we can easily define a default operation for folding over instances of `List[A]`. Let's call this new method `foldMap` (we'll come to the `map` part in a bit):

~~~ scala
List(1, 2, 3).foldMap
// res0: List[Int] = 6
~~~

Implement `foldMap` now. Use an `implicit class` to add the method to `List[A]` for any `A`. The method should automatically select an appropriate `Monoid[A]` using implicits:

<div class="solution">
There are two possible solutions to this. Each involves defining an `implicit class` to wrap `List[A]` and provide the `foldMap` method. We'll call this implicit class `FoldMapOps`.

The first solution puts a context bound on the type parameter for `FoldMapOps`. This restricts the compiler so it can only materialize a `FoldMapOps[A]` if there is a `Monoid[A]` in scope:

~~~ scala
implicit class FoldMapOps[A: Monoid](base: List[A]) {
  def foldMap: A =
    base.foldLeft(mzero[A])(_ |+| _)
}
~~~

The second solution moves the implicit parameter to the `foldMap` method. This allows the compiler to materialize `FoldMapOps` for any `A`, but prevents us calling `foldMap` unless there is a `Monoid` in scope.

~~~ scala
implicit class FoldMapOps[A](base: List[A]) {
  def foldMap(implicit monoid: Monoid[A]): A =
    base.foldLeft(mzero[A])(_ |+| _)
}
~~~

Either of these approaches works just fine, but the second implementation is mildly preferable because of the error messages it generates when there is no matching `Monoid` in scope. Putting the context bound on the constructor gives us the following:

~~~ scala
List('a, 'b, 'c).foldMap
// <console>:16: error: value foldMap is not a member of List[Symbol]
//               List('a, 'b, 'c).foldMap
//                                ^
~~~

whereas putting the parameter on `foldMap` gives us a much more precise error message:

~~~ scala
List('a, 'b, 'c).foldMap
// <console>:16: error: could not find implicit value â†©
//    for parameter monoid: scalaz.Monoid[Symbol]
//               List('a, 'b, 'c).foldMap
//                                ^
~~~
</div>

Now let's implement the `map` part of `foldMap`. Extend `foldMap` so it takes a function of type `A => B`, where there is a monoid for `B`, and returns a result of type `B`. If no function is specified it should default to the identity function `a => a`. Here's an example:

~~~ scala
List(1, 2, 3).foldMap[Int]()
// res0: Int = 6

List("1", "2", "3").foldMap[Int](_.toInt)
// res1: Int = 6
~~~

Note: we no longer need a monoid for `A`.

<div class="solution">
~~~ scala
implicit class FoldMapOps[A](base: List[A]) {
  def foldMap[B : Monoid](f: A => B = (a: A) => a): B =
    base.foldLeft(mzero[B])(_ |+| f(_))
}
~~~
</div>

It won't come as a surprise to learn we aren't the first to make this connection between fold and monoids. Scalaz provides an abstraction called [`Foldable`][scalaz.Foldable] that implements `foldMap`. We can use it by importing `scalaz.syntax.foldable._`:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.std.anyVal._
import scalaz.std.list._
import scalaz.syntax.foldable._

List(1, 2, 3).foldMap()
// res2: Int = 6

List(1, 2, 3).foldMap(_.toString)
// res3: String = "123"
~~~

Scalaz provides a number of instances for `Foldable`:

~~~ scala
import scalaz.std.iterable._
import scalaz.std.tuple._
import scalaz.std.string._

Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2).foldMap()
// res4: (String, Int) = (ab, 3)

Set(1, 2, 3).foldMap(_.toString)
// res5: String = "123"
~~~
