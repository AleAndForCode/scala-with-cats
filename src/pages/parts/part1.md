\part{Foundations}

In this first part of the book we're building the foundational strategies on which the rest of the book will build and elaborate. 
In Chapter [@sec:adt] we look at algebraic data types, which are our main way of modelling data.
We turn to codata in Chapter [@sec:codata], which is the opposite, or dual, or algebraic data.
Type classes are the focus on Chapter [@sec:type-classes], while fundamentals of interpreters are discussed in Chapter [@sec:interpreters]. These four strategies all describe code artifacts. For example, we can label part of code as an algebraic data type or a type class. We'll also see strategies that help us write code but don't necessarily end up directly reflected in it, such as following the types.
