\part{Type Classes}

In this part of the book we move on to type classes.
We looked at the implementation of type classes in Chapter [@sec:type-classes].
Our focus here is on a handful of specific type classes,
that are both very useful for day-to-day programming tasks
and as conceptual models that can drive program design.
In this part we'll be looking more at their use for day-to-day programming,
while the case studies will focus on their role in design.

In Chapter [@sec:cats] we introduce the [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats) library.
Cats provides implementation of the type classes we're interested in,
and so it saves a lot of time and typing to use it.
