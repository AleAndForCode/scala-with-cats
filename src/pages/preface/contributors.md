## Acknowledgements {-}

No book is an island.
This book wouldn't exist without it's predecessor, *Scala with Cats*.
Everyone involved in creating that book implicitly played some part in this book's creation.
See below for that book's acknowledgements, but in particular I want to highlight my coauthor,
Dave "Lord of Types" Gurnell, without whom that book would not exist and hence neither would this one.

Thanks also to Adam Rosien, who gave me low-key encouragement and put up with my bullshit. Also my wife and children, who put up with even more of my bullshit, and gave me the space to finish this project.
The members of ScalaBridge London and attendees at various training courses acted as experimental subjects for a lot of the material here. Thank you for being willing test subjects; you greatly helped improve the content.
Finally, thanks for the members of the PLT research group who set me on this path over two decades ago and continue to provide inspiration from afar.
