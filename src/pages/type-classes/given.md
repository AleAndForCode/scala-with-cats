## The Mechanics of Contextual Abstraction

In section we'll go through the main Scala language features for contextual abstraction. Once we have a firm understanding of the mechanics of contextual abstraction we'll move on to their use.

The language features for contextual abstraction have changed name from Scala 2 to Scala 3, but they work in largely the same way. In the table below I show the Scala 3 features, and their Scala 2 equivalents. If you use Scala 2 you'll find that most of the code works simply by replacing `given` with `implicit val` and `using` with `implicit`.

+------------------+---------------------+
| Scala 3          | Scala 2             |
+==================+=====================+
| given instance   | implicit value      |
+------------------+---------------------+
| using clause     | implicit parameter  |
+------------------+---------------------+

Let's now explain how these language features work.


### Using Clauses

We'll start with **using clauses**. A using clause is a method parameter list that starts with the `using` keyword. We use the term **context parameters** for the parameters in a using clause.

```scala mdoc:silent
def double(using x: Int) = x + x
```

The `using` keyword applies to all parameters in the list, so in `add` below both `x` and `y` are context parameters.

```scala mdoc:silent
def add(using x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
```

We can have normal parameter lists, and multiple using clauses, in the same method.

```scala mdoc:silent
def addAll(x: Int)(using y: Int)(using z: Int): Int =
  x + y + z
```

We cannot pass parameters to a using clause in the normal way. We must proceed the parameters with the `using` keyword as shown below.

```scala mdoc
double(using 1)
add(using 1, 2)
addAll(1)(using 2)(using 3)
```

However this is not the typical way to pass parameters. In fact we don't usually explicit pass parameters to using clause at all. We usually use given instances instead, so let's turn to them.


### Given Instances

A given instance is a value that is defined with the `given` keyword. Here's a simple example.

```scala mdoc:silent
given theMagicNumber: Int = 3
```

We can use a given instance like a normal value.

```scala mdoc:silent
theMagicNumber * 2
```

However, it's more common to use them with a using clause. When we call a method that has a using clause, and we do not explicitly supply values for the context parameters, the compiler will look for given instances of the required type. If it finds a given instance it will automatically use it to complete the method call.

For example, we defined `double` above with a single `Int` context parameter. The given instance we just defined, `theMagicNumber`, also has type `Int`. So if we call `double` without providing any value for the context parameter the compiler will provide the value `theMagicNumber` for us.

```scala mdoc
double
```

The same given instance will be used for multiple parameters in a using clause with the same type, as in `add` defined above.

```scala mdoc
add
```

The above are the most important points for using clauses and given instances. We'll now turn to some of the details of their semantics.


### Given Scope and Imports

Given instances are usually not explicitly passed to using clauses.
Their whole reason for existence is to get the compiler to do this for us.
This could make code hard to understand, so we need to be very clear about which given instances are candidates to be supplied to a using clause.
In this section we'll look at the **given scope**, which is all the places that the compiler will look for given instances, and the special syntax for importing given instances.

The first rule we should know about the given scope is that it starts at the **call site**, where the method with a using clause is called, not at the **definition site** where the method is defined.
This means the following code does not compile, because the given instance is not in scope at the call site, even though it is in scope at the definition site.

```scala mdoc:reset:fail
object A {
  given a: Int = 1
  def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
}

A.whichInt
```

The second rule, which we have been relying on in all our examples so far, is that the given scope includes the **lexical scope** at the call site.
The lexical scope is where we usually look up the values associated with names (like the names of method parameters or `val` declarations).
This means the following code works, as `a` is defined in a scope that includes the call site.

```scala mdoc:silent
object A {
  given a: Int = 1
  
  object B {
    C.whichInt 
  }
  
  object C {
    def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
  }
}
```

However, if there are multiple given instances in the same scope the compiler will not arbitrarily choose one.
Instead it fails with an error telling us the choice is ambiguous.

```scala
object A {
  given a: Int = 1
  given b: Int = 2
    
  def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
    
  whichInt
}
// error:
// Ambiguous given instances: both given instance a in object A and
// given instance b in object A match type Int of parameter int of 
// method whichInt in object A
```

We can import given instances from other scopes, just like we can import normal declarations, but we must explicitly say we want to import given instances. The following code does not work because we have not explicitly imported the given instances.

```scala mdoc:reset:fail
object A {
  given a: Int = 1

  def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
}
object B {
  import A.*
    
  whichInt
}
```

It works when we do explicitly import them using `import A.given`.

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
object A {
  given a: Int = 1

  def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
}
object B {
  import A.{given, *}
    
  whichInt
}
```

One final wrinkle: the given scope includes the companion objects of any type involved in the type of the using clause. 
This is best illustrated with an example.
We'll start by defining a type `Sound` that represents the sound made by its type variable `A`, and a method `soundOf` to access that sound.

```scala mdoc:reset
trait Sound[A] {
  def sound: String
}

def soundOf[A](using s: Sound[A]): String =
  s.sound
```

Now we'll define some given instances. Notice that they are defined on the relevant companion objects.

```scala mdoc:silent
trait Cat
object Cat {
  given catSound: Sound[Cat] =
    new Sound[Cat]{
      def sound: String = "meow"
    }
}

trait Dog
object Dog {
  given dogSound: Sound[Dog] = 
    new Sound[Dog]{
      def sound: String = "woof"
    }
}
```

When we call `soundOf` we don't have to explicitly bring the instances into scope. They are automatically in the given scope by virtue of being defined on the companion objects of the types we use (`Cat` and `Dog`). If we had defined these instances on the `Sound` companion object they would also be in the given scope; when looking for a `Sound[A]` both the companion objects of `Sound` and `A` are in scope.

```scala mdoc
soundOf[Cat]
soundOf[Dog]
```

We should almost always be defining given instances on companion objects. This simple organization scheme means that users do not have to explicitly import them but can easily find the implementations if they wish to inspect them.


#### Given Instance Priority

Notice that given instance selection is based entirely on types. We don't even pass any values to `soundOf`! This means given instances are easiest to use when there is only one instance for each type. In this case we can just put the instances on a relevant companion object and everything works out.

However, this is not always possible (though it's often an indication of a bad design if it is not). For cases where we need multiple instances for a type, we can use the instance priority rules to select between them. We'll look at the three most important rules below.

The first rule is that explicitly passing an instance takes priority over everything else.

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
given a: Int = 1
def whichInt(using int: Int): Int = int
```
```scala mdoc
whichInt(using 2)
```
   
The second rule is that instances in the lexical scope take priority over instances in a companion object

```scala mdoc:reset:silent
trait Sound[A] {
  def sound: String
}
trait Cat
object Cat {
  given catSound: Sound[Cat] =
    new Sound[Cat]{
      def sound: String = "meow"
    }
}

def soundOf[A](using s: Sound[A]): String =
  s.sound
```
```scala mdoc
given purr: Sound[Cat]  =
  new Sound[Cat]{
    def sound: String = "purr"
  }

soundOf[Cat]
```
   
The final rule is that instances in a closer lexical scope take preference over those further away.

```scala mdoc
{
  given growl: Sound[Cat] =
   new Sound[Cat]{
     def sound: String = "growl"
   }
   
  {
    given mew: Sound[Cat] =
     new Sound[Cat]{
       def sound: String = "mew"
     }
     
    soundOf[Cat]
  }
}
```
   
We're now seen most of the details of how given instances and using clauses work. This is a craft level explanation, and it naturally leads to the question: where would use these tools? This is what we'll address next, where we look at type classes and their implementation in Scala.
