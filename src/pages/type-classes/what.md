## What Type Classes Are

We've have now seen the mechanics of type classes: they are a specific arrangement of trait, given instances, and using clauses. This is a very craft-level explanation. Let's now raise the level of the explanation with three different views of type classes.

The first view goes back Chapter [@sec:codata], where we looked at codata. The type class itself---the trait---is an example of codata with the usual advantages of codata (we can easily add implementations) and disadvantages (we cannot easily change the interface). Given instances and using clauses add the ability to chose the codata implementation based on the type of the context parameter and the instances in the given scope, and to compose instances from smaller components.

Raising the level of abstraction again, we can say that type classes allow us to implement functionality (the type class instance) separately from the type to which it applies, so that the implementation only needs to be defined at the point of the use---the call site---not at the point of declaration.

Raising the level again, we can say type classes allow us to implement **ad-hoc polymorphism**. I find it easiest to understand ad-hoc polymorphism in contrast to **parametric polymorphism**. Parametric polymorphism is what we get with type parameters, also known as generic types. It allows us to treat all types in a uniform way. For example, the following function calculates the length of any list of an arbitrary type `A`.

```scala mdoc:silent
def length[A](list: List[A]): Int =
  list match {
    case Nil => 0
    case x :: xs => 1 + length(xs)
  }
```

We can implement `length` because we don't require any particular functionality from the values of type `A` that make up the elements of the list. We don't call any methods on them, and indeed we cannot call any methods on them because we don't know what concrete type `A` will be at the point where `length` is defined[^abstraction].

Ad-hoc polymorphism allows us to call methods on values with a generic type. The methods we can call are exactly those defined by the type class. For example, we can use the `Numeric` type class from the standard library to write a method that adds together elements of any type that implements that type class.

```scala mdoc:silent
import scala.math.Numeric

def add[A](x: A, y: A)(using n: Numeric[A]): A = {
  n.plus(x, y)
}
```

So parametric polymorphism can be understood as meaning any type, while ad-hoc polymorphism means any type *that also implements this functionality*. In ad-hoc polymorphism there doesn't have to be any particular type relationship between the concrete types that implement the functionality of interest. This is in contast to object-oriented style polymorphism (i.e. codata) where all concrete types must be subtypes of the type that defines the functionality of interest.

[^abstraction]: Parametric polymorphism represents an abstraction boundary. At the point of definition we don't know the concrete types that `A` will take; the concrete types are only known at the point of use. (Once again we see the distinction between definition site and call site.) This abstraction boundary allows a kind of reasoning known as *free theorems* [@10.1145/99370.99404]. For example, if we see a function with type `A => A` we know it must be the identity function. This is the only possible function with this type. Unfortunately the JVM allows us to break the abstraction boundary introduced by parametric polymorphism. We can call `equals`, `hashCode`, and a few other methods on all values, and we can inspect runtime tags that reflect some type information at run-time.
