There are two major things missing from this version of the book:

1.  We are missing a few summary chapters. These include a condensed discussion of the concepts we've covered in the book.

2.  We are missing the case studies that make up the last third of the book. These are in various states of completion so we have chosen to hold them back until we have a better idea of what they will look like.
