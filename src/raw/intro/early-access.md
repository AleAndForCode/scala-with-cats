### Changelog {-}

Starting from the February 2016 release, here are the major changes to the book:

- Started to shift all code from Scalaz to Cats (currently version `0.4.0-SNAPSHOT`). Three chapters have been converted.

- Added a new case study which builds a validation library. This case study introduces Kleislis.

- Revamped the introduction to Applicatives to emphasise their use for combining values in a context, which is more idiomatic in Scala than the typical presentation.

### Omissions {-}

Here are the major things missing from the book:

1. We haven't made the graphics for the graphical notation we've used to great effect to teach these concepts in our training courses.

2.  We are missing a few summary chapters. These include a condensed discussion of the concepts we've covered in the book.

3.  We are missing some of the case studies that make up the last third of the book. These are in various states of completion so we have chosen to hold them back until we have a better idea of what they will look like.

4. Not all the code has been converted from Scalaz to Cats.
