## Conclusions

This case study has been an exercise in removing rather than building abstractions. We started with a fairly complex `Check` type and peeled away components till we were left with `Predicate`. 

`Predicate` is very much like a stripped down version of the matchers found in testing libraries like ScalaTest and Specs2. 

Implementing `not`

Disjunctive normal form.
